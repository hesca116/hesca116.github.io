      <h2>Alignment </h2> 
      <h3>Rolling Stone Magazine</h3> <br>

      <div>The principle of <b>Alignment</b> is featured in the foreground boxes that show the images of this design. The smaller boxes are top-aligned to each other, and they are also verticallyl aligned to the top box. <br>
      Also, the text inside the top box is properly aligned to the left, and the width of the heading <b>"Political Commentary"</b> matches that of the subheading in <b>bold letters.</b>
      These elements create a sense of organization in the first elements we see on this website.</div> <br>

      <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2> 
      <h3>Simply Chocolate</h3> <br>
      <a href="https://simplychocolate.dk/">simplychocolate.dk</a> <br>
      <img src="/lesson02/images/02visualHierarchy_LoRes.jpg" alt="Mobile screenshot of Simply Chocolate's website"> <br>
      <div>The principle of <b>Visual Hierarchy</b> is properly applied on this website. The contrast between the colors creates visual interest in the <b>chocolate bar</b>, which is the most important element of the design. Then, the eye flows naturally upward because the chocolate crums on the white negative space move in that direction when the user scrolls down. On the way up, we see the second element: the call to action button titled <b>"ADD TO BOX"</b>. Finally, the third element is the main heading, which is easily readable thanks to its capitalized font and its high contrast. </div> <br>

      <h2>Fitts Law</h2> 
      <h3>A Fork and a Pencil</h3> <br>
      <a href="https://aforkandapencil.com/">aforkandapencil.com</a> <br>
      <img src="/lesson02/images/03fittsLaw_LoRes.jpg" alt="Mobile screenshot of A Fork and a Pencil's website"> <br>
      <div>This design is a good example of <b>Fitt's Law.</b> The size of the boxes that show the recipes is directly proportional to their interaction priority. These boxes are easy to reach and easy to click or tap. The design reflects the <b>objective of the website</b> as soon as you see it. The <b>predominant sizes </b>of these boxes communicate that they are frequently used, which increases the effectiveness of the design in terms of usability.</div> <br>
